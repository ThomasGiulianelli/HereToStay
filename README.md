Here To Stay is an android application that is meant to provide useful information regarding a person's rights in the United States. 
This information includes civil rights regarding certain subjects and tips for how to act when you are in certain situations.
In the future we intend to add note-taking and video-recording support so that a user can keep records of incidents.
